# Python ChatBot Project

This project is a Python-based chatbot that utilizes various libraries to provide functionalities like responding to user queries, checking server status, and more. It's structured to be modular, with separate components for different tasks.

## TODO

- Add help function
- Add stuff from AIsuite

## Features

- **[ChatBot Prompts](cogs/ChatBotPrompts.py)**: Handles dynamic conversation flows.
- **[Ping](cogs/Ping.py)**: Checks and reports server status.
- **[Status](cogs/Status.py)**: Provides the current status of the chatbot.

## Dependencies

The project relies on several third-party libraries, including:

- `urllib3` for HTTP requests.
- `websockets` for WebSocket communication.
- `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests.
- `distro` for Linux distribution information.
- `sniffio` for detecting the async library in use.
- `discord.py` for directly interfacing with Discord.
- `openai` for accessing OpenAI's APIs.

For a full list of dependencies, refer to the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.
